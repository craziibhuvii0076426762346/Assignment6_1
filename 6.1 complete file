file2 = foreach file1 generate occupation,date;
 
file3 = foreach file2 generate occupation,ToDate(date,'MM/dd/yy') as date;
 
file4 = filter file3 by ((date> ToDate('1/11/99','MM/dd/yy')) AND (date<ToDate('6/11/99','MM/dd/yy')));
 
file5 = group file4 by occupation;
file6 = foreach file5 generate group, COUNT(file4) as count;
 
file7 = order file6 by count desc;
 
file8 = limit file7 5;

dump file8;
